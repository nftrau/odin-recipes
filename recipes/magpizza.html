            <p>Where do I begin about this beauty? This was the first pizza I made with my <b><i>wife.</i></b>  Made with a thin crust and with a combination of 3 different types of cheese, and the overdose of peppeorni, it just makes you go <i id="mammamia">Mamma Mia.</i></p>
            <p>Creating this pizza if I'll be honest; messy and tiring, but it'll be worth it once you master this craft.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)</li>
                <li>2-3 <b>grated</b> fresh garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil </li>
                <li>2-3 large pinches of kosher salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subtitle steps"><i>Steps</i></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don’t worry.</li>
                <li>Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. <b>Proofing Tip:</b>If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen.</li>
                <li><b>Preheat Oven:</b> Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour.</li>
                <li>As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.</li>
                <li>Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Assemble the Pizza with your favourite toppings!</li>
                <li>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!
                Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.</li>
