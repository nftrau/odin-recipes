My first html project; Project: Recipes.
I will be embarking on this journey to create a Recipe website.
Let's document along the way!

1. 1st Nov:
Did the main index.html file
Included in various elements:
- headings, lists, anchor (href), and img (src) of 3 recipes
- created 3 recipes html links in the recipe/ directory
- created anchor links with target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" so it opens in a new tab

2. 2nd Nov:
- added description, ordered and unordered lists in the individual recipes
- used different headings from h1 to h4
- added unordered lists, ordered lists, bold and italic
- added new images in individual recipes
