My first html project; Project: Recipes.
I will be embarking on this journey to create a Recipe website.
Let's document along the way!

----- ON 1 NOV 3:30PM -----
Did the main index.html file
Included in various elements:
- headings, lists, anchor (href), and img (src) of 3 recipes
- created 3 recipes html links in the recipe/ directory
- created anchor links with target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" so it opens in a new tab

----- ON 2 NOV 6:30PM -----
- added description, ordered and unordered lists in the individual recipes
- used different headings from h1 to h4
- added unordered lists, ordered lists, bold and italic
- added new images in individual recipes


----- ON 14 NOV 10:30PM -----
- Managed to beautify recipe website using css styles
- Yet to try out; Group, Chaining, Descendant selectors
- Should try it on the different recipe links!
